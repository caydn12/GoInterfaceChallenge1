Interface Challenge 1. Will post requirements below:

Write a program that creates two custom struct types called 'triangle' and 'square'

The 'square' type should be a struct with a field called 'sideLength' of type float64

The 'triangle' type should be a struct with a field called 'height' of type float64, and a field of type 'base' of type float64

Both types should have a function called 'getArea' that returns the calculated area of the square or triangle

Area of a triangle = (base * height) / 2
Area of a square = sideLength * sideLength

define a function called 'printArea' that takes a parameter of shape
This function should calculate the area of the given shape and print it out to the terminal

Design the interface so that the 'printArea' function can be called with either a triangle or a square
